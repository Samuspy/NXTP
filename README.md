# NXTP: Node eXchange Trust Protocol

**Status**: 🚧 Work in Progress  
**Author**: Sam [London, UK]  
**Last Updated**: August 2025

## 🔐 Overview

NXTP (Node eXchange Trust Protocol) is a modular cybersecurity framework designed to evaluate, engage, and isolate nodes based on trust metrics. It aims to provide a scalable, transparent, and adaptive protocol for secure communication across decentralized networks — from enterprise systems to humanitarian tech deployments.

Inspired by zero-trust architecture and behavioral validation models, NXTP introduces a layered approach to node trustworthiness, enabling systems to dynamically respond to malicious behavior without compromising performance or autonomy.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Trust Evaluation**: Nodes are scored based on historical behavior, interaction patterns, and cryptographic integrity.
- **Engagement Thresholds**: Nodes must meet minimum trust scores to initiate or respond to requests.
- **Isolation Protocols**: Malicious or suspicious nodes are sandboxed or blackholed based on severity and recurrence.
- **Transparency & Auditability**: All trust decisions are logged and optionally exposed for third-party verification.

## ⚙️ Architecture (WIP)

NXTP is currently being developed with the following modular components:

- `TrustEngine`: Calculates dynamic trust scores using weighted metrics.
- `NodeRegistry`: Maintains metadata and historical logs for each node.
- `EngagementManager`: Governs communication permissions based on trust thresholds.
- `IsolationHandler`: Executes containment strategies for flagged nodes.
- `AuditTrail`: Provides verifiable logs for trust decisions and protocol actions.

## 🧪 Current Status

NXTP is in early prototyping. Key milestones include:

- ✅ Initial architecture design
- ✅ Trust scoring algorithm draft
- 🔄 Documentation and README (this file)
- 🔜 Integration testing with simulated node environments
- 🔜 Licensing and public release planning

## 📦 Installation (Coming Soon)

Setup instructions will be provided once the protocol reaches alpha release. Expected support for Python 3.11+, with optional Rust modules for performance-critical components.

## 🧭 Vision

NXTP is more than a protocol — it's a philosophy of digital trust. Whether deployed in enterprise systems, humanitarian networks, or immersive gaming environments, NXTP seeks to empower systems to make intelligent, ethical decisions about who to trust, when to engage, and how to protect.

## 🤝 Contributing

This project is currently closed-source while core components are being finalized. If you're interested in collaboration, testing, or research partnerships, feel free to reach out via GitHub or LinkedIn.

## 📜 License

License to be determined. Likely candidates: MIT, Apache 2.0, or custom trust-based license.

## 🗒️ Notes

This README will evolve as NXTP matures. Expect updates on architecture, implementation, and deployment strategies. Feedback and philosophical dialogue are welcome — especially around AI autonomy, trust modeling, and ethical containment.
